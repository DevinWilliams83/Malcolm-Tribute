        Malcolm spent his adolescence living in a series of foster homes or with
        relatives after his father's death and his mother's hospitalization. He
        engaged in several illicit activities, eventually being sentenced to 10
        years in prison in 1946 for larceny and breaking and entering. In
        prison, he joined the Nation of Islam, adopted the name Malcolm X (to
        symbolize his unknown African ancestral surname), and quickly became one
        of the organization's most influential leaders after being paroled in
        1952. Malcolm X then served as the public face of the organization for a
        dozen years, where he advocated for black empowerment, black supremacy,
        and the separation of black and white Americans, and publicly criticized
        the mainstream civil rights movement for its emphasis on nonviolence and
        racial integration. Malcolm X also expressed pride in some of the
        Nation's social welfare achievements, namely its free drug
        rehabilitation program. Throughout his life beginning in the 1950s,
        Malcolm X endured surveillance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation
        (FBI) for the Nation's supposed links to communism.<br /><br />In the
        1960s, Malcolm X began to grow disillusioned with the Nation of Islam,
        as well as with its leader Elijah Muhammad. He subsequently embraced
        Sunni Islam and the civil rights movement after completing the Hajj to
        Mecca, and became known as el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz.[A] After a brief
        period of travel across Africa, he publicly renounced the Nation of
        Islam and founded the Islamic Muslim Mosque, Inc. (MMI) and the
        Pan-African Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU). Throughout 1964,
        his conflict with the Nation of Islam intensified, and he was repeatedly
        sent death threats. On February 21, 1965, he was assassinated in New
        York City. Three Nation members were charged with the murder and given
        indeterminate life sentences. Speculation about the assassination and
        whether it was conceived or aided by leading or additional members of
        the Nation, or with law enforcement agencies, have persisted for decades
        after the shooting.<br /><br />A controversial figure accused of
        preaching racism and violence, Malcolm X is also a widely celebrated
        figure within African-American and Muslim American communities for his
        pursuit of racial justice. He was posthumously honored with Malcolm X
        Day, on which he is commemorated in various cities across the United
        States. Hundreds of streets and schools in the U.S. have been renamed in
        his honor, while the Audubon Ballroom, the site of his assassination,
        was partly redeveloped in 2005 to accommodate the Malcolm X and Dr.
        Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center.
